## Project Overview
* Created a tool that predicts whether a cancer patient's tumor is present in their bone tissue, or elsewhere
* Pulled and formatted data from ICGC using python
* Engineered features to track each patient's genetic mutations as variables in a machine learning algorithm
* Utilised Random Forest Classifier model
* Determined that classifying tumor locations using the available mutation data was not possible.
* The above visualisation demonstrates this: red and blue data points show far too significant overlap to differentiate.
