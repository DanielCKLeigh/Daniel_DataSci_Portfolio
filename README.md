# [Project 1: Predicting the Location of Cancer based on Genetic Mutations](https://github.com/DanielCKLeigh/Daniel_DataSci_Portfolio/blob/main/p01-cancer.ipynb)
## Project Overview
* Created a tool that predicts whether a cancer patient's tumor is present in their bone tissue, or elsewhere
* Pulled and formatted data from ICGC using python
* Engineered features to track each patient's genetic mutations as variables in a machine learning algorithm
* Optimised Random Forest Regressor to reach the best model
